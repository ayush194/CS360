Welcome to Cannons !!

Cannons is a simple inefficient two-player arcade game, where the user player fights a bot player in a serious battle of Cannon Balls. The cannon balls upon landing gives hitpoints to the cannons which lie in the hit zone. The first player to receive 5 hitpoints loses.The game in built entirely in deprecated OpenGL 2.1 API  and hence is quite inefficient, but nevertheless does the job for this simple game.

Fight the Bot till death !

Watch Out! There is also a wind blowing in a random direction which could affect the motion of the projectiles, so you need to be super careful.

### Controls:
	1. Move the cannon in its arena with 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' keys.
	2. Change the muzzle angle w.r.t horizontal/vertical using 'a', 'w', 's', 'd' keys.
	3. Decrease/Increase the muzzle velocity of the cannon with 'c', 'v' keys.
	4. Shoot the cannon with the 'f' key.

Enjoy!
